# Data_Science_Web_Apps

Thanks to Chanin Nantasenamat (aka Data Professor) at freeCodeCamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM&t=555s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

Each completed through the guidance mentioned above. A fun and insightful learning experience that I would highly recommend!

To take a look and enjoy, please download the files and run locally:
- Any missing packages will be easy to identify as they are always imported in my first lines of code
- No need to download any .ipynb files. These were used in the process of building the apps and are only included in case of interest.
- The molecular solubility predictor app will require the logo.jpg and the solubility_model.pkl
- Although if you wish to rerun locally, and play with potential adjustments, please feel free to download the Solubility_Model_Building.ipynb and make your own model :)
